# Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive solution for efficient event management, encompassing a robust REST server and an intuitive graphical user interface. The server prioritizes hypermedia principles, efficient event filtering, ordering, and effective caching strategies. The Postman collection has been expanded for thorough testing of hypermedia links.

## Project Components

### 1. REST Server

- Prioritizes high standards with a focus on hypermedia links, event filtering, and ordering.
- Seamless integration of efficient caching strategies for optimized performance.

### 2. Graphical User Interface Implementation

- Implementation of a user-friendly graphical interface enhancing user interaction with events.
- Displays events in a tabular format, showcasing 10 to 20 entries.

### 3. Postman Test Cases

- Enriched Postman collection with additional test cases for comprehensive hypermedia link verification.
- Custom scripts added for rigorous testing of all hypermedia links.

### 4. Hypermedia Principles

- Strict adherence to hypermedia principles in server implementation to ensure reliance on server-provided hyperlinks.

### 5. Filtering and Ordering

- Facilitates easy event customization through user-defined attribute filtering.
- Seamless integration of ordering functionality for flexible arrangements based on various attributes.

### 6. Caching Implementation

- Implemented effective caching strategies within the server to boost performance and responsiveness.

### 7. Model Classes for Events

- Meticulously developed model classes for events, aligned with attributes from the existing Postman collection.

### 8. Server Functionality

- The server effortlessly runs provided test cases upon startup, with at least one event populated in the database.

### 9. Paging Functionality

- Seamless integration of paging functionality using offset/size parameters.

### 10. Hyperlinks

- Thoughtfully provided hyperlinks throughout the graphical user interface, encompassing filtering, ordering, and reversing order attributes.

### 11. Graphical User Interface

- The graphical user interface showcases events in a table with 10 to 20 entries.
- Clicking on a row opens a detailed view of the corresponding event.
- Provides support for paging, filtering, and sorting through hyperlinks supplied by the server.
